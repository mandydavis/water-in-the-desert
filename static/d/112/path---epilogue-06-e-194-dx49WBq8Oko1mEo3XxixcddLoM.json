That is, before this project I knew there was a certain significance to water in the desert. What I did not realize is how present water has been in my desert life. Not only does it sustain me, it is also omnipresent. I could look through nearly any period of my life and find photographs of water in Arizona. This may seem like a contradiction, but if this project has demonstrated anything it is that water is both scarce (sometimes) and, without doubt, sacred.  </p>\n<p>Water in the desert holds a special significance that draws in the fascination of someone passing by. Water in the desert has always been instantly available in abundance from my sink, but upon reflection, I have also always viewed water in desert as a scarce, sacred miracle. For that is the reason I believe I have so much photographic evidence throughout my years of living in the desert. </p>\n<p>I love when it rains in Phoenix, and I hate when it rains in Evanston. Water is different in the desert.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Epilogue","date":"May 02, 2019","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQAB/8QAFwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABUwbazWi4f//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMQERP/2gAIAQEAAQUCy7GK177SP//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/AYf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGn/8QAFhABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDEA/9oACAEBAAY/Am6n/8QAGxABAQABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUFhgaH/2gAIAQEAAT8hGWzbh2hD7uby/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABB0z//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAEDAQE/ECP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH/2gAIAQIBAT8QNj//xAAaEAADAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASERMVGR/9oACAEBAAE/ENkYodDSrucui9f02j0ceT//2Q==","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/10fb1/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg","srcSet":"/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/467b3/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 340w,\n/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/e1ddd/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 680w,\n/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/10fb1/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 1360w,\n/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/fda29/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 2040w,\n/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/823a4/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 2720w,\n/water-in-the-desert/static/9af97112484a86683a11e92a21bad7de/a8d59/epilogue_thumbnail.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/epilogue/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gila-river/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ch 4: Gila River Case Study"}}}}
